## Description
This challenge was to use the existing code and write javascript functions and loops to generate passwords with a given criteria.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The password generator creates a random password based on user input. The user selects the length of the password from 8-128 characters. If a number outside of these values is selected, an alert notifies the user to select a value between 8-128. The user then decides whether to include: lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters. 

## Credits
